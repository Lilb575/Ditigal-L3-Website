      <h1>Janet Frame</h1>
      <p>
        Janet, born in 1924 in Dunedin, grew up in poverty and faced additional personal struggles,
        including a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia that led to years in psychiatric hospitals.
        Despite these difficulties, education provided her with a way forward. She pursued studies
        at the University of Otago and Dunedin Teachers' College, where she developed her talent
        for writing. Her literary success eventually allowed her to escape financial instability
        and build a sustainable career.

      <h1>Jonah Lomu</h1>
      <p>
        Jonah Lomu, born in 1975 in Auckland, used his natural athletic talent to rise above
        financial hardship. Growing up in a working-class Tongan family, he experienced financial
        struggles, but his ability in rugby opened doors for him. At just 19 years old, he became
        the youngest player to debut for the All Blacks. His remarkable speed and strength made him
        a global rugby icon, securing financial stability and opportunities that lifted him and his
        family out of poverty.

      <p>
        Alexia Hilbertidou faced financial barriers and limited opportunities, but rather than
        letting this hold her back, she took advantage of education, leadership programs, and
        networking opportunities. She actively sought scholarships and free learning resources to
        further her education. By building connections and engaging in mentorship, she developed
        her entrepreneurial skills and created her own career pathâ€”demonstrating how ambition and
        resourcefulness can help overcome financial challenges.
